"ML-Assignment-1.pdf" is the question that is answered in this attachment.

Every code is in ".ipynb" format. The ipynb is python notebook file. And must be opened in jupyter notebook.

There are 3 subfolders in the attachement, namely:
1. Squared Error
2. Mean Absolute Error
3. Fourth Power Error

Since the assignment has to be done for four different sizes of datasets, viz. 10, 100, 1000, 10000, each subfolder has four files for four dataset sizes. Each file is named by its dataset size. For eg: for dataset size = 1000, the file name is "Data_1000.ipynb".
Each file can be opned in jupyter notebook and executed for the results.

Since, the input data is generated randomly, on running the code you would generate different result from the one mentioned in the report. EACH FILE IS ALREADY EXECUTED AND CONTAINS THE RESULT. PLEASE CHECK THE RESULTS AND REPORT BEFORE EXECUTING THE CODE.

In part 3 of the assignment we have to plot the learning curve of how train and test error varies with increase in size of datasets.
From the result of the report, I have used n=4 model, i.e. Y = β0 + β1*X + β2*X2 + β3*X3 + β4*X4 to plot this curve. The code for the plot of the variation of train and test error with increase in size of datasets is contained in the "Part3_plot.ipynb" file. To get this plot, please run "Part3_plot.ipynb" file in jupyter notebook.

Report.pdf contains the report for this assignment.
